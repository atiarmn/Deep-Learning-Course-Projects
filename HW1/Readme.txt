Hi!

To execute the code, ensure that the “KidCreative.csv” file is located in the “Source Code” folder (it's already placed there). Then, run the command "python main.py" in the terminal.

The default activation function is the logistic sigmoid, initialized as follows:
L3 = LogisticSigmoidLayer.LogisticSigmoidLayer()

You have the option to switch to other activation functions, all of which are imported in the main.py file. For instance, to use the ReLU activation function, you can modify the code like this:
L3 = ReLULayer.ReLULayer()

Thank you!
