Hi!

To execute the code, ensure that the “KidCreative.csv” and "medical.csv" files are located in the “Source Code” folder (They're already placed there). Then, to run the linear regression codes, run the command "python LinearRegression.py" in the terminal. And to run the Logistic regression codes, run the command "python LogisticRegression.py" in the terminal.

Also, for the gradient decent visualization section, you can run "python VisGrad.py". 

Thank you!
